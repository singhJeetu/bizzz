I
f you’re confused with all the
information about what

mask to wear, and how CO-
VID­19 is transmitted in the fi

rst
place (aerosols? surfaces?),
you’re like most people who
have a dozen masks around the
house, with no clarity on what
works best. Here, doctors give
us some gyan.
Why should I wear a mask
when those around me
already are?
If you’re late to the game, then
know that masks fulfi

l two pur-
poses: they prevent the transmis-
sion of the novel coronavirus (and

other pathogens — viruses and
bacteria) from you (if you have it),
via little droplets when you
breathe hard, speak, sneeze,
cough, or sing. They also prevent
the same from other people. Over
120 countries have asked citizens

to wear masks in public spaces ac-
cording to Oxford University’s

news piece put out in July.
Even if everyone around you
is wearing a mask, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has

not ruled out aerosol transmis-
sion in closed settings “particu-
larly in these indoor locations

where there are crowded and in-
adequately ventilated spaces

where infected persons spend

long periods of time with oth-
ers.” Look at them as personal

protective equipment if you’re

going to work in an air­condi-
tioned offi

ce with several peo-
ple, for instance, even if you’re

keeping a metre­long distance.
What is N95 mask?
The ideal is the respirator mask
(N100, N99, N95), designed for
poultry cleaning or logging —

high virus or dust loaded envi-
ronments. It was meant to be

worn for no longer than eight
hours, to protect the wearer.
The N stands for non­oil,
meaning an industry can choose
this if there is no oil present in
the air. There are also R and P

masks, where R means oil is pre-
sent; P is when oil is present.

The number stands for the ex-
pectation that the fi

lter will trap
95% particles. So an N95 mask
“fi
lters at least 95% of airborne
particles but is not resistant to

oil,” as per the Centers for Dis-
ease Control, US. These are cer-
tifi

cations provided by Ameri-
ca’s National Institute for

Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH). Reputed companies

will generally say on their pack-
aging that they are NIOSH certi-
fi

ed. Do check this, as there are
several fakes in the market.

KN95 are the Chinese equiva-
lent of the N95.

“The salient features of these
masks are that they provide a
complete seal around the nose
and mouth [a gasket fi
tting that

provides no leakage],” says Am-
barish Satwik, a vascular and

endovascular surgeon in Sir
Ganga Ram Hospital. “They also
